Orwell is best known for his works Animal Farm (1945) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), both of which are considered cornerstones of modern English literature and have had a lasting impact on political thought. Animal Farm, an allegorical novella satirizing the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism, has become a standard in literature about totalitarianism and political corruption. Nineteen Eighty-Four, a dystopian novel set in a totalitarian society controlled by Big Brother, has influenced political discourse around surveillance, propaganda, and government control. Orwell's writings often sexplore themes of social injustice, totalitarianism, and the misuse of power. He was an ardent critic of fascism and communism and was deeply involved in political activism, including fighting in the Spanish Civil War, which influenced his strong anti-authoritarian views. Orwell's style is known for its clarity, precision, and biting social commentary, and his work continues to be relevant and influential in discussions on politics, language, and individual rights. Orwell passed away in 1950 at the age of 46, but his work remains widely read and influential, especially in the context of discussions surrounding state power, civil liberties, and the role of the individual in society.",
