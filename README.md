# BookHub

BookHub is a full-featured web application for book lovers. It allows users to manage books and authors, write and vote on reviews, create personalized reading lists, read articles, and participate in chats. 
> This project is my final course assignment for the SoftUni C# Web track. The entire application is fully Dockerized.

## üìê Project Structure and Architecture

### üìä Database

![Database Schema](./screenshots/db.png)

---

### üîß Back-End Architecture

BookHub uses a classic monolithic 3-layer architecture: **Web**, **Service**, and **Data** layers.

![Server Structure](./screenshots/server.png)

#### **Areas**
![Areas](./screenshots/areas.png)  
Minimal logic; includes:
- `AdminApiController` base controller
- Admin ID retrieval service

#### **Common**
- Global constants
- Shared exception: `DbEntityNotFoundException`

#### **Data**
![Data](./screenshots/data.png)  
- `Base`: Abstract base entities with audit fields
- `Shared`: Entities like `BookGenre` for many-to-many relationships
- `BookHubDbContext.cs`:
  - `ApplyAuditInfo()` for automatic audit fields (created by/on, modified by/on)
  - **Global Query Filters**:
    - `IApprovableEntity`: filters unapproved entries
    - `IDeletableEntity`: filters soft-deleted entities

#### **Infrastructure**
![Infrastructure](./screenshots/infrastructure.png)

- **Extensions**: Modular startup setup via extension methods:
  - `AddDatabase`, `AddIdentity`, `AddJwtAuthentication`, `AddSwagger`
  - `AddServices`: Registers services by convention using marker interfaces (`IScopedService`, `ITransientService`, `ISingletonService`)
  - `AddApiControllers`, `AddAutoMapper`, `GetAppSettings`

- **Filters**:
  - `ModelOrNotFoundActionFilter`: Returns `BadRequest` if null, `Ok` otherwise

- **Services**:
  - `CurrentUserService`: Retrieves current user context
  - `Result` and `ResultWith<T>` for standardized success/failure responses

#### **Features**
![Features](./screenshots/features.png)

Each feature has its own directory containing:

- **Web**:
  - **Controllers**: User/Admin separation
  - **Models**: Input validation for client-side data

- **Service**:
  - **Models**: Internal service models decoupled from web
  - **Implementation**: Interfaces + logic

- **Mapper**:
  - AutoMapper profiles
  - Manual mapping where necessary

- **Data**:
  - Entity models, EF configurations, and feature-specific seeders

- **Shared**:
  - Validation constants, enums, etc.

#### **Tests**
![Tests](./screenshots/tests.png)

- Uses EF InMemory
- Dependencies mocked with Moq
- AutoMapper is not mocked
- FluentAssertions used for expressive tests

### üíª Front-End Architecture

![Client Structure](./screenshots/client.png)

Logic is offloaded from components into custom hooks that call `fetch()` wrappers. Component ‚Üí Hook ‚Üí API file.

#### `assets`
Static images

#### `api`
![API](./screenshots/api.png)
- Each backend feature has a corresponding JS file
- Handles token auth, builds endpoints, and returns processed results

#### `common`
Constants, error messages, and utility functions

#### `components`
![Components](./screenshots/components.png)  
All JSX files per feature

#### `contexts`
- `MessageContext`: Displays global alerts
- `UserContext`: Tracks and persists user state, profile status, and admin rights

#### `hooks`
![Hooks](./screenshots/hooks.png)  
Feature logic in hooks like `useBookDetails()`

#### `App.jsx` & Custom Routing

Inside `src/components/common`:

- **AuthenticatedRoute**: Redirects unauthenticated users to login
- **AdminRoute**: Redirects non-admins to "Access Denied"
- **ProfileRoute**: Ensures user has a profile before accessing features
- **ChatRoute**: Ensures user is part of the chat before showing chat details

These routes improve UX but rely on back-end validation for security.
